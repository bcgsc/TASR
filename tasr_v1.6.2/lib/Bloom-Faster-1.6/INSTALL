option 2: build libbloom as a shared library.  this will make its routines available to other programs (that you might write), as well as installing bloom, a c executable implementing a bloom filter.  

cd leopold-0.7
./configure
make 
sudo make install
cd ..
cp Makefile.shared Makefile.PL
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
sudo make install
