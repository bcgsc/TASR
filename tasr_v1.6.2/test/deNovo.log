=>Reading sequences. Initiated Fri Sep 23 08:29:45 PDT 2016
Checking SRR066437.fastq...ok
Checking sequence target file targets.fa...ok

Using target sequence file targets.fa for this assembly.
Note: ONLY sequences in targets.fa will be used as seeds (i.e. files listed in -f NGSreads.fof will NOT be used as seeds, only used for extension)

Candidate sequence reads imported from file 1/1, SRR066437.fastq:
337 sequences (135 unique overall)
Total reads interrogated (total bases): 4738411 (156367563) -- human genome equivalent(s) = 0.052122521
-i has been set to 1, which means the target sequences are USED for recruiting reads for de novo assembly, NOT target-based reference guided assemblies
Number of unique target/seed sequences: 135
